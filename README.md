# NoteFlow: A Note-Taking App

This project aims to build a note-taking application inspired by the features and functionality of Microsoft OneNote. The goal is to create a versatile and user-friendly platform for capturing, organizing, and accessing information.

## Key Features:

### User Interface:

The UI will be designed to be intuitive and familiar, with a hierarchical structure similar to OneNote's notebooks, sections, and pages. It will feature a clean and organized layout for easy navigation and note management.

### Note Creation and Editing:

Users will be able to create rich-text notes with various formatting options (bold, italics, lists, etc.). Support for embedding images, links, and other media will be included. A robust editor will provide a seamless writing experience.

### Organization:

Notes will be organized into notebooks, sections, and individual pages. Users will be able to easily move, copy, and rearrange notes within this structure. Tagging functionality will also be implemented for additional categorization and filtering.

### Syncing and Storage:

The application will support cloud synchronization to allow users to access their notes across multiple devices. The backend storage mechanism will be designed for reliability and data integrity.

### Search:

A powerful search function will enable users to quickly find specific notes based on keywords, tags, or content.

### Collaboration:

Future iterations may include features for sharing notebooks or sections with others and potentially real-time collaborative editing.
